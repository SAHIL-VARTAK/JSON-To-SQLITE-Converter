# JSON-To-SQLITE-Converter

This code is written in Python to easily insert all your JSON data into a new SQLITE Database.

Copy your json file into this folder.

Then create a new database using the create_sqlite_db.py file or drop your existing database into this folder.

Finally, change the parameters in the insert_json_into_sqlite.py file to match your database and json file.
